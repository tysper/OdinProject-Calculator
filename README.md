# OdinProject-Calculator
The project consists of a basic calculator to practice all the learning from the course "The Odin Project"

The main dificuties when building this project was:

- State Managing,
- Being able to get the last result and work on it,
- Data flow

It was a very fun project to build and I practiced a lot my skills, so I am pretty happy with the final result, you can see the preview clicking on the following link: <a href="https://elastic-bell-73be48.netlify.app/">Live preview</a>
